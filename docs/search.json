    "text": "Rust is a emerging new system programming language.But what is system programming language? A system programming language is like any other programming langauge except it provides full control over hardware ,manual memory management ,abstraction without overhead to implement system level software,run on bare metal(Without any operating system).So why another system programming language since we have c/c++.\nWhat others tells about rust Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux,consider a rust as second language for the kernel development.\nThe quotes below from Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich in Twitter.\nCurrently rust is the best alternative to c/c++ by Levin Microsoft\nRust is most loved by developers in five years row ,a survey conducted by stackoverflow.\nnow look at the feature ,the language provide.\nZero cost abstraction Abstraction in system programming language don’t impose any additional overhead.Because it’s a system programming language introducing abstraction means reduce the development time,less code,expressive. Zero cost FFI because of lack of GC.\nAOT(Ahead of Time)\nRust compiler(rustc) is a gatekeeper to refuse a code that violates the compiler rules without even running a program thus the execution and startup speed is low once executable file generated but also compiler optimize\nGuaranteed memory safety\nMove Semantics\nFearless concurrency.\nTools and productivity\nCargo -a build tool and package manager like Pip for python,Npm fo js but for a system PL since c/c++ doesn’t have universal supports(Make,Microsoft c++ package manager).\nClippy command used find non idiomatic rust like ESLinter for js.\nRustfmt command line tool to standardize coding style like Pretty for js.\nRustup -Command line tool to install rust,rust components cargo,targets for cross compilation,change the rustc version(stable,nightly,beta)\nRust Language Server(rls) used in intelligence IDE to provide syntax highlighting,code completion,pointing error.\nRust Docs includes std library documentation,rust book,rust reference book when installing rust locally.\nRustDoc Generating documents embedded in rust source code via ‘///’ then rendering on Doc.rs\nBuild in testing framework via test macros\nModule system to manage large programs.\nBecause rust is a system programming language it supports condtional compilation,staticlib,dynamic library .\nRust playground for playing with the language instantly in the web browser without installing rust on local.\nRust is a modern system programming language in addition to memory safe without using Garbage Collector.Is modern in a sense that these features are available in high level dynamic programming language not implemented in system programming lanaguage.Functional programming features are include(In the context of haskell-a pure functional programming language)\nGenerics Reduce code duplication.Supports static dispatch and virtual dispatch. Traits are like Interface in Java but more flexibility,Protocols in Swift,Type Classes in Haskell provide abstraction,safety. Pattern Matching like switch in c but more powerful can be used wide variety of pattern than ‘if’ expression.Rust is expression oriented programming langauge. Enum -A user defined data type ,can contains data,more compact.Used with pattern matching cause they are like unions only field at a time is used not variants. Hygienic Macros-To generate boilerplate rust code for you ,expanded when compiling so you code looks clean. Closure-A anonymous function.You can do interesting thing with them. Robust error handling strategies through Result & Option Type,using from ,into traits through ? operator.You never forgot to check error as the compiler force you to do it ,the exhaustive nature of pattern matching. Type aliasing. Boxing.The syntax are clearer than the c,c++ counterpart.what’s more the rust is most loved PL for developers for a 5 years as surveyed by anual stackoverflow.\nRust foundation is backed by big players that include Microsoft, Meta, Dropbox, Arm, Google, Amazon ,Shopify.and others.Rust is a future proof language. Rust conference videos are uploaded in youtube.\nAPI Documentation of dependency if available through crates.io -No internet required once it’s build by “cargo build” command.\nCargo SemVer(Semantic Version)-Only update the minor,patches not the major version unless we specify explicitly what we are doing.\nHigh level ergonomics to use Dynamic Data structure through Box,Smart pointers Rc,Arc,Automatic cleanup of resources, Operator overloading through Traits.DerefMut,Ops-implement the custom behavior to your type like indexing,compound assignment operator or method call.It’s feel like i own the rust ,like it’s designed for your own .Type Inference,implicit,Elided.\nBackward compatibility-This is important for to Evolve language feature as well as not breaking the code due to introducing new feature to the language.This is reason why c/C++ barely introduce any new features it will break code since it’s already span millions of lines code in production.Beta,stable,Nightly.\nAutomatic scoped management for memory ,non_memory resources,locks,smart pointers are phenomenal since no human intervention is needed and also no runtime cost for that.(More on that later)\nUsed by Linux,fb,google android-fushia os,DropBox,Firfox,Amazon.\nCompiler errors are contain rich information about what went wrong ,where that happened if code doesn’t compile and also suggest to fix that.This is important since rust introduce unique concepts Like ownership,borrow,lifetime to rule out use after free, double free, dangling pointer, iterator invalidation,concurrency bug at compile time.Don’t worry if those words strange to you as they are explained in next blog post with rust code examples.\nCustom types to encode the business logic ,validation.\nOne of the most supports of webassembly -the protable runtime for web,desktop,cloud,blockchain where isolation,startup time is important.Webassembly runtime wasmtime itself written in rust.\nBecause most of the errors are moved to compile time ,they unlikely to crash at runtime.Like haskell once it’s compiles it’s just work.\nIf you start a new project that needs to be run as efficient as possible without memory bugs also no GC then consider using rust.\nRust is interoperable with other PL through FFI.So instead of writing from scratch(Which is often unsuccesful)just rewrite the part that need to be run fast and won’t crash at runtime.Using FFI for Elexir ,they reduce the latency down to nano seconds.Tilde rewrite the HTTP end points in rust the gain was phenomenol,from 5GB memory(Java) to 50MB memory usage.(cloud bill also reduced as a side effect).Supports dynlib-so we can use that library at runtime like libc.\nLast but not least is Rust is a green language i.e energy efficient.It’s important characteristics to consider since most of the world communicate through softwares.It’s impact is huge since IoT on scale of billions thus reducing carbon footprints as well as secure .\nI think that rust is going to be a programming language that c++ creater anticipated in his paper “History of c++” at end of the paper.\nTrade off that accepts before rust came: Speed,safety,Easy to use-Pick two. Language tend to provide safety,easy of use like python,java,js but not speed.Languages like c/c++ provide speed but unsafe. For Rust -Pick three but at what cost.Rust puts lot of restriction on the programmer side so it’s essential to learn foundational concepts of rust in upfront to successfully compile the rust code.\nResources for further learning about rust: Rust official Website Free high quality Rust book Programming rust book Why scientist turns into rust by Nature Why rust so popular by stackoverflow  Rust Ergonomics Seamless Integration with c History of c++\nFootNotes: I never used c/c++ for anything useful other than 101.I find that it’s difficult to understand the code moreover the pointers are..Rust is much more ergonomics than c++"

    "text": "Zero cost abstraction is a memory model for system programming language that provides abstraction that are equivalent to hand written low level code without any additional overhead ,proposed by Stroustrup in his paper Abstraction and C++ machine model.Let’s decompose them to explain their properties.\nZero:\nIt’s still cost but compared to other high level languages(Python,Java,C#) they have little overhead when using virtual dispatch.Once c/c++ compiler emit the assembly from the source code through GCC or LLVM the compiler no longer needed which means we can distribute executable files without end user installed c/c++.Where as in dynamic programming languages the source code and the language runtime must always sit behind to run the program.Just because we have lots of memory that doesn’t mean use all of that,that’s what garbage collector do.Where as in embedded system memory is measured in KiloBytes rather than GigaBytes,TeraBytes in PC,supercomputers in that gc is not an option other than using c/c++ or now rust.It’s fast as the hardware allowed.\nCost:\nEvery computation we perform have cost associated with it ,how much resources(time and space) needed to run a particular kind of task.Garbage collected languages takes more memory than necessary than manual memory management languages like c,c++,rust.\nAbstraction :"
